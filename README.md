<h1>Tank Wars - Iteration II</h1>
<p>
The given assignment required students to re-implement a previous prototype and improve upon its main mechanics and dynamics. The aim was to 
teach students the process of iterative design and how a game developer must always be able to take what has been made and make it better.
Additionally, the re-implementation of the prototype had to contain elements of well thought out level design as well as good communication 
and feedback systems. 

<h2>Prototype Chosen</h2>
</p>
The prototype chosen to undergo this process was Tank Wars, as it had great potential and could be improved further, according to feedback from 
play-testers.

<h2>Game Synopsis</h2>
<p>
Tank Wars is a top down shooter game where the player plays as a tank and has to fight off an avalanche of enemies in the form of other tanks,
that come in phases. But unlike other shooter games, where the player uses conventional means to take out enemies, such as shooting projectiles, 
the core/main mechanic of shooting has been taken out. Instead, the player is given the ability to manipulate time through their movements and 
use it, together with their spatial awareness, to taking out enemies using their crossfire. 
As stated, the player manipulates time through movement. When the player is stationary, time progresses at a slow rate whereas when they are 
moving, time progresses at a normal rate. This was a mechanic added to compensate for the removal of the shooting mechanic and not have the player at a disadvantage.
</p> 

<h2>Inspirations</h2>
<p>
Tank Wars takes inspiration from the game Superhot as well as the mobile game Stickman Tank.
The former is a first-person shooter with a twist. In the game, the player attempts to take out enemy targets using guns and other weapons, 
but time within the game progresses at a slow rate unless unitl the player moves, at which it progresses at a normal rate. This creates the 
opportunity for the player to assess their situation and respond accordingly.
<br>
The latter is a fast-paced 3D tank simulator where the player attempts to take out enemy targets using cannons and other weapons.

<h2>Iterative Changes </h2>
There were countless changes made from each iteration, but the most notable of these can be categorised as changes made to the following. 

<h3> Shooting</h3>
<p>
In the initial version of the game, the player had to take out enemy targets using their spatial reasoning skills, i.e. position themselves such that the enemies take each other out. Unfortunately, this proved difficult as there were too many bullets that the player had to dodge and therefore, they would die very quickly. To make things less difficult, the player was given the ability to shoot with a limited amount of ammunition as well as immunity. They would sometimes get more in the form of loot by killing enemies. 
</p>
<p>
But because the game was created with a specific intention, it was decided it was best to revert back to the initial state of the game where the player had no ability to shoot and revisit the idea and come up with a way to better equip the player such that they are able to take on the task. One such measure was to include a mini-map that players could use to orienting themselves within the game world and be able to keep track of where enemies were around them. When implemented, this did not accomplish what was expected as the players, rather than using the main screen, would use the mini-map instead. From there it was thought best to change the game from a third-person shooter to a top down game, as shown below.

<h3>Spawning of Enemies</h3>
 
<p>
In the initial prototype, enemies spawned randomly at specific positions and would move towards the players while shooting at them. This proved good enough for the prototype but could be further improved upon. This was to be done with the process of dynamic game difficulty balancing in mind. This is the process of automatically changing parameters, scenarios, and behaviors in real time, based on the playerâ€™s ability, in order to avoid making the player bored (if the game is to easy) or frustrated (if it is too hard).
</p>

<p>
To accomplish this, it was decided that having different phases within the game would greatly improve the quality of the game as well as the experience. Each phase would represent a level of difficulty, i.e. in the beginning of the game, enemies would spawn at a very slow rate and as the game progressed, the rate would increase gradually, thereby increasing the difficulty. This is done to get the player accustomed with the controls as well as the task they need to accomplish in the first few phases.

<h2>Future Improvements</h2> 
<p>
The following section describes the areas with the most potential for improvement within Tank Wars. This iteration of the prototype fell short of the initial vision in many ways, and there were some clear problems within the final design, but given more time most of these issues can be addressed and repaired. 
</p>

<h3>Better Tutorials and Communication</h3>
<p>
The game was initially designed to teach the player how to use their controls through careful tutorial design, but this was not seen in the final product as it was decided to teach the player how the controls work as the game progresses. But this did not work efficiently as the players had trouble reading the instructions and play at the same time. This can be improved by adding a tutorial that explores each individual mechanic before the game.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2> 
<p>
The given assignment required students to re-implement a previous prototype and improve on its main mechanics and dynamics and followed an iterative design process. Tank Wars was created as a solution to the presented problem. In the beginning it took the form of a challenging third-person shooter game but was later changed to a top down game. The intention was to make a game that fit a certain genre but was missing one of the main mechanics that is usually found in that genre. Play testers responded positively to the main elements of the final product but this iteration of the prototype had some clear problems within the final design which were not up to standard, thus the game could not be considered a complete success, even though it did address much of what it initially set out to do. Given more time, better tutorials could be created as well as more visual and audio cues which would both guide and teach the player.
